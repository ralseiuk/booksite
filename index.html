<p style="color:white;">On a very bright and sunny day in 2018 at 17:38 Zaccadiah wumpy-paws was born inside a ballpit located inside zach and puppets pizza; Just off exit
34 on highway 11 in the sleepy little town of Zinkleburr, Colorado. He was the pride and joy of one Mr. Tom Johnes and a woman by the name of Ms. Wumpy-paws who would later appear on the side of a milk carton. Flash forward a couple years and Zacc was now Quebec bound on the way to his latest restaurant Frebbys fabulous pizza. Now, having arrived Zacc finds himself accompanied by his new robotic coworker Lolbit who became a robot as the result of a horrible accident (that we will never mention). Zacc's boss Mr. Bärenmeister greeted him at the door with a welcome basket full of variously shaped sponges and 1 (one) eggplant. *flashfoward again*
(you didn't miss anything Zacc was just using the big bears room and reading apl․de․ap's autobiography) it is now 11:59 pm and the niceguard (it's spelt like that on purpose) Zaul "flappyknees" Bärenmeister had just arrived for his nite shift , by the way it is night o'clock in the middle of the knight; did I mention it was night because it is definitely night. Meanwhile Zacc awoke from a peaceful nap on a toliet in the staff bathroom to find not only had his Gameboy been replaced with a PSP but the PSP wasn't charged. The latter caused Zacc to cuss out every historically important president (Obama) after he finished his little temper tantrum Zacc proceeded to stomp his fat little stompers all way down to Zaul's office. Upon arriving at Zaul's office Zacc demanded he return his Gameboy,  a demand which promptly resulted in Zaul laughing and swiftly slapping Zaccs balls like a professional ping pong player. He then shoved Zacc out and slammed the door, after being throughly demoralized Zacc waddled his tight little ass cheeks to the stage to have a good cry.  Noticing their friend was acting up Lolbit decided to go and ask him what was wrong, "what's wrong?" Enquired Lolbit "Who asked" replied Zacc which promptly turned Lolbit into a sobbing whore. Well these two effeminate gender neutral (and male) momma lovers cried their little hearts out Zaul was busy preparing his well muscled arm for his daily heroin overdose. Zaul unbuttoned his shirt revealing his "do not resicate" tattoo and erect piereced nipples, he proceeded to try and find a vein, after succeeding he tied a condom he found in the trash around his arm and prayed today was the day he wouldn't survive before pushing the syringe into his arm and moaning as the heroin pumped through his veins and his eyes rolled back into his head. A little Taiwanese boy doing the cabbage patch danced through his head, he supposed the boy must be mocking him for all of his past failures. Zaul had never been able to accomplish much in his miserable 32 years on this planet . He had wanted to be a lawyer but after 3 failed attempts at the bar he turned to the military enlisting with the marines. Basic had been the one thing he could pass, the only thing he manged to pass and the thing he regretted the most. 6 months after passing he'd been shipped to Iraq just in time for the second battle of Fallujah. Now that had been hell, sniper fire whizzing by kicking up dust, depriving your lungs of air and briefly blinding you. Zaul remembered being pinned on a rooftop waiting for reinforcements, watching his entire platoon get picked off one at a time. But he had lived, why him? He wondered Why was he special? Why had he deserved to live and not so many others. After being discharged he searched for that answer of at the bottom of every bottle of booze he could find until finally he crashed his car into a family headed back from a Chucky Cheese (good riddance). They never had a chance. That was when Zaul realized he had a probelm so he attended AA meetings  and eventually was a year sober. Then he reconnected with his old highschool sweetheart got married had a kid and found a steady job peddling insurance. Of course he still had to see a shrink for the PTSD but everything was good. Until he came home and found a man in bed with his wife, Zaul snapped. They never found the bodies and his daughter Zemily went to live with a nice family in Michigan. Zaul then contacted his dad who hooked him up with work in Quebec and that brings us to the present day. Meanwhile Zacc and Lolbit were playing a horrible game of chess so horrible I can't bare to describe it so I'll leave that up to your imagination.  Zacc being the sore loser he is slapped the board Into Lobits face causing pieces to become lodged in their supple flesh. Lolbit then proceed to perfectly replicate a dial tone sound well simultaneously evacuating their tears all over Zacc's fresh new Sketchers® (sponsored), luckily Zacc had fourteen more pairs handy. After changing into a fresh set of kicks Zacc decided to leave Lolbit to their sniveling and check in on Zaul; Upon arriving at his office Zacc noticed Zaul was doing the worm (nice moves) and frothing at the mouth. Fearing the worst Zacc went to grab the nearby defibrillator but accidentally grabbed the fire extinguisher instead which somehow still revived Zaul. Zaul slowly opened his eyes and looked up at Zacc realizing quickly that deaths warm embrace had once again been thwarted by some nosy little do goober. Deciding he couldn't stand to be here another second Zaul handed Zacc the keys told him to lock up and headed home to take a cold shower and sleep on the floor. Once Zaul had exited and Zacc shook off his mometary shock he decided to snoop on Zaul's gaming computer. Not being a computer hacker or even very smart he decided to start opening files finding 1tb of baby sensory videos, a pirated copy of portal 3, unedited and unreleased the oddities™ videos, a pdf of the communist manifesto, a tech support scam script and in his desk a weird sponge that was so hard Zacc mistook it for a brick at first. Just then the replacement night guard walked in and upon seeing what Zacc was up to tazed him. Zacc awoke trapped under a laundry basket with the aforementioned sponge atop it, looking to his left he noticed Lolbit was still crying for some reason. Looking to his right he noticed that Zaul had returned and was now dressed as a lobster for some reason. Zaul seeing that Zacc was now awake screamed at the top of his lungs "RON RON GO GET HIM" After which a burly man dressed in a sun bleached rainbow bunny costume that was a few sizes too small stumbled out of Lolbits ass and bounded over to Zacc where he proceeded to relentlessly give him wet willys. Zacc suddenly awoke passed on the floor in a puddle of drool with Lolbit shaking him frantically. Zacc turned to Lolbit and asked them where Ron ron was , "whos Ron Ron" replied Lolbit but just as they said that the man, the myth, the legend himself Ron Ron emerged from Lolbits ass accompanied by the sweet guitar riffs of Carlos Santana.  At that very moment a giant meteor on a crash course for earth came hurdling through the sky on direct path to destroy Frebbys fabulous pizza world (and the earth) right before it hit, zacc in an impeccable Wile e Coyote impression said "I hope this doesn't effect the development of FNaZ64 (A little Zacc appears holding a sign that says Zacc-wee mama). Zacc awoke from a deep restless slumber to a distant sound of beeping upon opening his eyes and surveying his surroundings Zacc came to the conclusion that he was currently in the ICU ward of Zipper Mcgraw memorial hospital. The incessant beeping originating from a heart monitor Zacc was attached to letting him know for the time being he was still alive, suddenly feeling very tired Zacc fell back in a decidedly more peaceful slumber. A few hours later  Zacc was awoken by a presence in the room the presence was none other than Frebby himself. Upon realizing Zacc was awake Frebby went on a long speech about something unimportant but zacc didn't listen to any of it because he was too busy playing zaccy bird on his Zphone. Frebby seemingly annoyed was about to smack Zacc up side the head but was interrupted by a doctor who had come in to let Zacc know he had been discharged and was free to go. After changing out of his robe into a gyaru, Zacc followed Freeby outside and got into his 2001 Ford Taurus. The drive back to the restaurant was silent which gave Zacc time to wonder what he had missed;15 minutes later they arrived at the restaurant. Zacc got put and looked up at the sign which now read "Frebbys Faboulous Flapjack Emporium" confused Zacc turned to Frebby and questioned him about the name change. Frebby than explained that 3 months after Zacc fell into a coma a 6 year old blonde tow-headed boy named Zarley had choked to death on an unpeeled grape while His mother had been preoccupied hitting on the animatrionics. Frebby explained that due to that incident they'd had to close down for a few months. During the shutdown Zaul had shown up at Frebbys house naked covered in dirt in the pouring rain and had pitched the idea of reinventing the restaurant to Frebby. Frebby loved it and now here we are. Zacc realizing he didn't care that much accepted the update and marched into the restaurant to assume his old post. Upon stepping foot into the restaurant Zacc noticed the lights were off, thinking the power was out Zacc went to try and turn the lights on. As soon as Zacc had flipped the switch the lights turned on and Zaul, Zaccs grandma, his old highschool principal and Matthew Patrick all jumped out and yelled "some fries". The shock caused Zacc to jump backwards where he accidentally bumped into his welcome back cake knocking it over. The cake hit the floor and the candles which someone had prelit for some reason bounce out and one landed directly on the table cloth igniting it. The table cloth burst into Flames and caught the nearby sculpture of Zacc that Zaul had made out of fireworks. The fireworks flew everywhere setting the entire place aflame. Thinking quickly Zaul grabbed everyone, put them on his shoulders, fireman's carry style and jogged for the exit. Once outside they called the fire department. Sadly they weren't able to salvage anything, Even sadder Frebby didn't have insurance and was now bankrupt. The Zend.</p>
